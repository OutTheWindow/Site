      animal miniatures, painted recreations of images from Facebook marketplace. They appear in nondescript positions, one cabinet sits outside on a lawn like some Bauhaus
      public work; a Persian rug sprawls out in a room of discreet belongings. Small handwritten subtitles give fragments of detail, places and prices. These elaborate

      the noise of so many things in a room. A keenly rendered bag of flour placed for scale becomes a character over the product itself, and with the decision in the
      placing of several fruits in front its seller seemingly creates a reference to a still life composition, intentionally or not.
