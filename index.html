      <p><em> Emily Seffar, Things I wish I bought on Facebook Marketplace, 2021

      <p><em>Grid of paintings on paper, hung on metal strips. An assortment of objects, carpets, chairs, shelving units, decorative glasses, potted plants,
      animal miniatures, painted recreations of images from Facebook marketplace. They appear in nondescript positions, one cabinet sits outside on a lawn like some Bauhaus
      public work; a Persian rug sprawls out in a room of discreet belongings. Small handwritten subtitles give fragments of detail, places and prices. These elaborate 
      advertisements for objects raise the simple beauty of things above what would be mundane cast-offs. They make you look closer as the details picked out rise above 
      the noise of so many things in a room. A keenly rendered bag of flour placed for scale becomes a character over the product itself, and with the decision in the
      placing of several fruits in front its seller seemingly creates a reference to a still life composition, intentionally or not.

      <p><em>A Bat with a half-moon grin, bursting out from behind a curtain. It strikes a pose of a vaudeville performer,
         larger than the frame can contain. Their piercing stare at its own shadow, entertaining themselves at least, even
         if we cannot see the reaction of the audience (if there is one). Then we see across the room the bat in reverse 
         performing their bit to a bright backdrop, a curtain half-way pulled out. Is this all a set for the cheeky 
         character or are we being introduced into their dramatic world whose world is a series of props and backdrops
         to dance their way through.

Another pair of images, a column image and a tall cloud, two figures spliced and combined with a screen of blue. 
         The repeated image of a cedar crowning both figures. Both of them show a plane, one holding on like some votive 
         object and another crashing into the top of their enlarged head. Reading the image up and down and up again, 
         like watching a remote plane being piloted by an erratic controller, veering one way then another, and the barest
         layer of gradient suggesting an open sky or plane of a lake, where this activity is taking place.
